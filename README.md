# **Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning in Sentiment Analysis** - 42 Urduliz Bizkaia AI Project

## **Project Overview**

This project introduces **Transfer Learning** in **Sentiment Analysis**, a key NLP technique used to determine whether a text conveys positive or negative sentiment. By leveraging **pretrained LLM models**, we aim to create a sentiment analysis system with minimal training data and computational resources.

The focus is on developing a binary sentiment analysis model using **transfer learning** techniques. Students will explore pretrained models, experiment with tokenization, and adjust **hyperparameters** to optimize performance while considering resource limitations.

## **Project Aim**

The project provides hands-on experience in:
1. **Transfer Learning**: Adapt pretrained models like **BERT**, **RoBERTa**, or **GPT-2** for sentiment analysis.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Create a binary classifier to categorize text (positive/negative).
3. **Tokenization**: Research and apply suitable tokenization methods.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters like **learning rate** and **batch size**.
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Train models within limited computing resources.

## **Key Features**
- Choose from a range of **pretrained models** (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).
- Flexible resources: Use **local or cloud computing** (e.g., **sgoinfre**).
- Customize the project based on personal research and interests.

## **Important Clarification**

The provided **sample dataset** is not intended for training but to give an idea of what sentiment analysis datasets look like. Please choose your own dataset (e.g., IMDB, Yelp, Amazon reviews) for training and evaluation.

## **Bonus Challenges**
- Test your model on additional datasets for generalization.
- Compare tokenization techniques.
- Deploy your model for real-time sentiment prediction via a web interface.

## **Note on Fine-Tuning**
**Fine-tuning pretrained models** is a critical part of this project. By adjusting hyperparameters and training on your specific dataset, you can improve model performance and efficiency.
